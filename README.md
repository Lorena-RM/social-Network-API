### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

The models that are created through [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) are used to create the data base to store all of our information. 

to Start we have our Database (A.k.A. usersDB) that can store our first 2 models 

![UsersDB](./assets/usersDB.png)

the **thoughts** model and the **users** model are the bases of how we are able to create a social network that can be used to make users and add friends as well as make thoughts or react to other users thoughts.

### User Schema 

our schema inside of the users model is to determine what kind of information we can allow it to store:

![UsersSchema](./assets/userSchema.png)

### Thought Schema 

The Thought Schema used inside of the Thought Model foler shows us what the requirements are for making a thought a.k.a like a base skeleton: 

![ThoughtSchema](./assets/thoughSchema.png)

### Reacrion Schema

The Reaction Schema is inside of the Thought model as is used as a subdocument schema in the Thought model: 

![ReactionSchema](./assets/reactionSchema.png)
